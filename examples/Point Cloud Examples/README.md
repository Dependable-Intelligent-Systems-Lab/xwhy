# Point Cloud Examples

# Description
This study explores the implementation of SMILE for Point Cloud offering enhanced robustness and interpretability, particularly when Anderson-Darling distance is used. The approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of fidelity loss, R^2 scores, and robustness across various kernel widths, perturbation numbers, and clustering configurations. Moreover, this study introduces a stability analysis for point cloud data using the Jaccard index, establishing a new benchmark and baseline for model stability in this field. The study further identifies dataset biases in the classification of the ‘person’ category, emphasizing the necessity for more comprehensive datasets in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and robotics. The results underscore the potential of advanced explainability models and highlight areas for future research, including the application of alternative surrogate models and explainability techniques in point cloud data.
